"""
Discussion: a true DAG can very well be between different node types (e.g. an article is related
to an organisation). The edge_model provides the necessary gearworks for this, but 
I don't think AL_NodeBase can handle it at this point.

The parent/child terminology is suitable for DAGs, but not for Directed Graphs that can allow cycles.

If we wanted to implement true DGs, a few steps should be taken: 
- AL_MemberBase (currently AL_NodeBase) should provide a parent/child-centric wrapper around 
  more generic methods in AL_NodeBase, likewise for Edge

  parent        director predecessor
  ancestor      predecessor
  child         direct successor
  descendants   successors
  
  child         tail
  parent        head
  
  tree          tree
  root          source
  leaf          sink
  flat branches => decomposition into parts
  
  free          isolated

- AL_NodeBase should be able to account for multiple relations, e.g. a node can be "siblings" with
  other nodes for a certain relation (say, they're about the same topic) but not for another relation
  (they're from different writers)

This might be a step-up from just using Django's ManyToManyFields as it would have a lot more
convenience methods for traversing relations than the plain Django ORM. However, it is not yet evident 
exactly how useful this would be. In addition, it would prohibit aligning this code with Treebeard
as Treebeard is very clearly focused on hierarchies, that is, relationships between nodes of 
the same type.

However, should I want to try this out, it's import to note that switching existing relations
to this system is minimally invasive. The code would mainly just provide a bunch of convenience methods 
and its data structure doesn't differ at all from plain m2ms in Django.

Conclusion: 
1. This app should be able to accomodate relationships between different models but doesn't.
2. DAG's are a very special subset of DG's. Supporting true DG's would require further abstraction.
