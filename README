This app implements directed acyclic graphs for Django, with an API that will be 
very familiar to people who've used Gustavo Picon's efficient tree implementations 
in django-treebeard before.

Works for me, but has no unit tests and may not see any improvements from me anytime 
soon. Just putting it out there in case it might be a useful starting point for 
somebody else.

django-treebeard-dag comes with a simplified BSD license, a very liberal license. 
See the included LICENSE file for details.
