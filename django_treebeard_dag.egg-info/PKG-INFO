Description: This app implements directed acyclic graphs for Django, with an API that will be
        very familiar to people who've used Gustavo Picon's efficient tree implementations
        in django-treebeard before.
        
        Works for me, but has no unit tests and may not see any improvements from me anytime
        soon. Just putting it out there in case it might be a useful starting point for
        somebody else.
        
        django-treebeard-dag comes with a simplified BSD license, a very liberal license.
        See the included LICENSE file for details.
